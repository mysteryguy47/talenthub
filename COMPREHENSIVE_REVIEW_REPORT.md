## 1. Backend Review

### 1.1 Schema Validation (`backend/schemas.py`)

**Status:** ✅ **GOOD**

- All question types properly defined in `QuestionType` literal
- All paper levels properly defined in `PaperLevel` literal
- Constraints model has proper validation ranges:
  - `digits`: 1-10 ✅
  - `rows`: 2-15 ✅
  - `rootDigits`: 1-15 ✅
  - `multiplierDigits`: 0-5 (0 for whole number in decimal multiplication) ✅
  - All other digit constraints properly bounded ✅

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ **MINOR**: `firstNumberDigits` and `secondNumberDigits` mentioned in frontend but backend uses `multiplicandDigits` and `multiplierDigits` for LCM/GCD. This is actually correct - the frontend correctly maps to these fields.

### 1.2 Math Generator (`backend/math_generator.py`)

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** (with minor notes)

#### All Operations Tested:
1. ✅ **Addition** - Generates correctly, handles all digit ranges
2. ✅ **Subtraction** - Never produces negative answers, validates digit counts
3. ✅ **Add/Sub Mix** - Ensures positive answers, handles operator distribution
4. ✅ **Multiplication** - Works with all digit combinations
5. ✅ **Division** - Always produces whole number answers, no division by zero
6. ✅ **Square Root** - Generates perfect squares, handles 1-15 digits
7. ✅ **Cube Root** - Generates perfect cubes, handles 1-15 digits
8. ✅ **Decimal Multiplication** - Correctly handles decimal places, whole number multipliers
9. ✅ **LCM** - Calculates correctly using `math.gcd`, ensures variety (a != b)
10. ✅ **GCD** - Calculates correctly using `math.gcd`, ensures variety (a != b)
11. ✅ **Integer Add/Sub** - Allows negative answers (as designed)
12. ✅ **Decimal Division** - Produces decimal answers, whole number operands
13. ✅ **Decimal Add/Sub Mix** - **FIXED**: No negatives in intermediate steps or final answer

#### Edge Cases Tested:
- ✅ Minimum constraints (1 digit, 2 rows)
- ✅ Maximum constraints (10 digits, 15 rows, 15 root digits)
- ✅ Answer bounds validation (minAnswer, maxAnswer)
- ✅ Retry logic prevents infinite recursion (max 20 retries)
- ✅ Fallback logic for edge cases

#### Randomness:
- ✅ Same seed produces same questions (deterministic)
- ✅ Different seeds produce different questions (9/10 unique in tests)
- ⚠️ **MINOR**: Question ID variation could be improved (7/10 unique) - but this is acceptable as question_id is meant to provide variation within a block, not complete uniqueness

#### Logic Validation:
- ✅ Subtraction: All answers positive
- ✅ Add/Sub Mix: All answers positive
- ✅ Division: All answers whole numbers, no division by zero
- ✅ Square Root: All are perfect squares
- ✅ Cube Root: All are perfect cubes
- ✅ LCM: Mathematically correct
- ✅ GCD: Mathematically correct
- ✅ Decimal Add/Sub: No negatives in intermediate steps

### 1.3 Main API (`backend/main.py`)

**Status:** ✅ **GOOD**

**Endpoints:**
- ✅ `/` - Root endpoint
- ✅ `/api/health` - Health check
- ✅ `/api/papers` - List papers
- ✅ `/api/papers/{paper_id}` - Get paper
- ✅ `/api/papers` (POST) - Create paper
- ✅ `/api/papers/preview` - Preview generation
- ✅ `/api/papers/generate-pdf` - PDF generation
- ✅ `/api/papers/{paper_id}/download` - Download saved paper

**Issues Found:**
- ✅ Error handling is comprehensive
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Validation error handling in place
- ⚠️ **MINOR**: Seed generation in preview uses `time.time() * 1000 + random.randint()` which is good for uniqueness, but could be simplified to just `random.randint(0, 2**31 - 1)` for true randomness

### 1.4 PDF Generator (`backend/pdf_generator.py`)

**Status:** ✅ **GOOD**

- ✅ Handles all question types
- ✅ Properly renders vertical and horizontal questions
- ✅ Handles special formatting for square root, cube root, LCM, GCD, decimal operations
- ✅ Page break logic works correctly
- ✅ Answer key generation works
- ✅ Multi-line text handling for decimal add/sub

**Issues Found:**
- ✅ No critical issues found

### 1.5 Presets (`backend/presets.py`)

**Status:** ✅ **GOOD**

- ✅ All levels properly defined (AB-1 through AB-6, Advanced)
- ✅ Advanced preset includes all new operations
- ⚠️ **MINOR**: Cube root preset uses `rootDigits=5` but default is 4. This is intentional for the preset, so it's fine.

### 1.6 Database Models (`backend/models.py`)

**Status:** ✅ **GOOD**

- ✅ Proper SQLAlchemy setup
- ✅ Paper model correctly defined
- ✅ Database initialization works
- ✅ Session management proper

---

## 2. Frontend Review

### 2.1 PaperCreate Component (`frontend/src/pages/PaperCreate.tsx`)

**Status:** ✅ **GOOD** (with minor notes)

**Features:**
- ✅ Block management (add, remove, reorder)
- ✅ Validation for all question types
- ✅ Auto-title generation
- ✅ Default constraint setting
- ✅ Level-based filtering (Basic vs Advanced operations)
- ✅ Preview and PDF generation

**Issues Found:**
- ✅ Validation logic is comprehensive
- ✅ Handles all constraint types correctly
- ⚠️ **MINOR**: The validation for `rootDigits` has a fallback that sets defaults if missing, which is good, but the logic could be simplified
- ✅ Auto-setting of `rootDigits` when type changes works correctly

### 2.2 MathQuestion Component (`frontend/src/components/MathQuestion.tsx`)

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

- ✅ Handles all question types correctly
- ✅ Special rendering for decimal add/sub (uses pre-formatted text)
- ✅ Special rendering for square root, cube root, LCM, GCD, decimal operations
- ✅ Proper decimal formatting
- ✅ Answer display formatting

**Issues Found:**
- ✅ No issues found

### 2.3 API Types (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)

**Status:** ✅ **GOOD**

- ✅ Types match backend schemas
- ✅ All question types included
- ✅ All constraint fields present
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types

---

## 3. Critical Issues Found

### 3.1 **NONE - All Critical Issues Resolved**

All previously identified issues have been fixed:
- ✅ Decimal add/sub no longer goes negative
- ✅ Square root and cube root display correctly
- ✅ LCM and GCD format correctly
- ✅ Decimal multiplication displays decimals
- ✅ All operations generate random questions

### 3.2 Minor Issues / Recommendations

1. **Seed Generation**: The preview endpoint uses `time.time() * 1000 + random.randint()` which works but could be simplified to just `random.randint(0, 2**31 - 1)` for cleaner code.

2. **Question ID Variation**: While acceptable, the variation by question_id could be improved slightly (currently 7/10 unique in tests). This is a very minor issue and doesn't affect functionality.

3. **Preset Consistency**: Cube root preset uses `rootDigits=5` while default is 4. This is intentional and fine, but worth noting.
